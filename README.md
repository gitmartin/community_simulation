code written by Martin Carrington to study the stability of Nash Equilibria.

- put f,g functions in p.m and q.m 
- distance.m used by p.m and q.m 
- run solver.m to solve for delta_d and delta_s as functions of time. 
- differential equation defined in delta_diffeq.m
- calcUC\*.m functions calculate consumption and production edge utilities for adjacent communities (so 4 functions)
